This is the source for [my website](https://uli.rocks)!

I'm currently using [next.js](https://nextjs.org), because I wanted to learn it. And
having the full power of javascript for writing html comes in handy.

If you get a headache from a static site written in react/nextjs. I totally understand. In fact I'll likely rewrite this in pure html/css at some point. However, It works for now and its fast enough.
