      <h2>Math</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently spending a large amount of my time studying math (~4h/day),
        I'm working to improve as fast as possible so I can start writing (and understanding) AI algorithms
        from the ground up.
      </p>
      <h2>Nerdsniper</h2>
      <p>
        I'm also working on <a href='https://nerdsniper.net'>nerdsniper</a>,
        a project to make connecting with like minded people deliberate as opposed to
        a game of chance. currently very alpha software.
        see my dedicated <a href='https://nerdsniper.net/about'>nerdsniper about page</a>
        <br />
        I'm spending ~80% of my time on Math & AI algorithms though, nerdsniper is coming along slowly.
