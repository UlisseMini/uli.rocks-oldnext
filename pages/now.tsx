      <h2>Math</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently spending a large amount of my time studying math (~4h/day),
        I'm working to improve as fast as possible so I can start writing (and understanding) AI algorithms
        from the ground up. (like CMA-ES, muzero, PPO etc)
      </p>
      <h2>Nerdsniper</h2>
      <p>
        I was working on <a href='https://nerdsniper.net'>nerdsniper</a>,
        a search engine over twitter users, maybe useful for finding people with similar interests
        see my dedicated <a href='https://nerdsniper.net/about'>nerdsniper about page</a>
        <br />
        I haven't been working on nerdsniper for awhile though, since I'm not using it. I might continue working on it later.
